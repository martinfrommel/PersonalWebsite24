# Personal Website

Welcome to the GitHub repository of my personal website! Built with the powerful and fast [Astro v4](https://astro.build/), this site showcases who I am, my recent projects, and some cool and funny features I'm currently working on. 🚀✨

## About Me

Hi there! I'm a developer passionate about creating beautiful and efficient web experiences. Through this website, I share my journey, projects, and in the future the occasional blog post about tech, design, and whatever catches my fancy. 🌟

## Features

- **Astro Markdown CMS**: Utilizes Astro's Markdown CMS for easy management of project showcases and blog posts. 📝
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Leverages Astro's SSG capabilities for a blazing-fast, SEO-friendly site. 🚀
- **CI Automation**: Integrated with GitHub Actions for continuous integration, ensuring the site is always up-to-date with minimal manual intervention. 🔧
- **AlpineJS**: Adds a dash of interactivity, mainly for theme switching, making the site not just informative but also engaging. 🌓
- **Open Source**: This project is open-source, meaning you're free to fork, modify, and use it as you see fit under the terms of the license provided. 💖

## TODO

- **Don't infer the image type in dynamic imports**: Need to fix this, currently all of the images are .png and it TS is just forced to assume the file type. This can lead to potential issues and inefficiencies in the codebase. It would be better to explicitly specify the image type in the dynamic imports to ensure proper handling and optimization.

- **Add my pixel-art avatar and its animations**: give a personalized touch and bring some visual interest to the website.

## Installation
