With the help of React, AWS Lambda, GraphQL and Prisma, I designed and built a modern website and a data ingestion tool in one for Jigsaw Music Group, a boutique music distribution and artist management company from South-East England.

The website is built to provide a simple and reliable way for the company's clients to be able to submit their releases with as little friction as possible, speeding up the process massively. The website features a fully-fledged user authentication and management system, a release review and submission system and other tools.
