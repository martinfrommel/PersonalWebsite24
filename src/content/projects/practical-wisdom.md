Practical Wisdom is a coaching non-profit with a big heart and an even bigger mission. I had the privilege of designing and developing their WordPress site, creating an online platform that truly reflects their dedication to changing lives.

Behind the scenes, I also streamlined their IT workflow, managing systems, email servers, CRM, and marketing. This project was a great opportunity to demonstrate my technical skills while supporting a cause I believe in.
