Pruvodce Broumovem (The Broumov Guide) is a project that brings the history of Broumov to life. Using Astro (v2), AlpineJS, and Netlify, I developed a website that offers a guided tour through this charming town.

The site combines historical elements with modern design, creating an engaging and educational experience for users. This project was a great opportunity to use web technologies to tell a fascinating story.
