Working with DDM Ulita Broumov was an adventure in creativity. I redesigned their website using WordPress, creating a digital space that showcases their diverse range of courses. From pottery to climbing, each course has its unique place on the site.

I also handle their domain administration and internal servers, ensuring a smooth and secure experience for their employees. This project allowed me to blend my passion for web development with my love for learning and creativity.
